# Robin Weitzman's Boiler Plate

## What this project is:
**You Can Use As Little Or As Much As You Need**

This is just a boiler plate set up project that contains a starter API call/render to help get you started on building out a project. It contains the following:
- React.js - framework for state management
- Next.js - for routing and API
- Jest - for testing
- Typescript - for strong typing Javascript
- ESLint - for formating (you can use Prettier instead if you like)

It has a API route's data already rendering, so you can feel free to mess around with that to start with.

## What this project isn't:

It doesn't have any CRUD beyond render, and it has tests but they don't test anything useful. I might add these features to the boiler plate in the future to simply make life easier for us all!

## How to use it:

Fork it and edit as you need! The goal is to give you a starter project to use whenever you want to create a project. I made this because I found that the most annoying thing of creating any project was the initial set up - getting the first API call to work and data to render, getting that first grid in, getting that first route working, the first tests working, and getting the formating all set up, too!!! Oh, the debugging to just get to work is... not something I want to deal with starting each and every time! These are all tedious processes in my opinion, and the impatience that surrounds starting up a new project is real - I JUST WANT TO GET INTO IT ALREADY.My hope is that you find this boiler plate useful, you use it multiple times, share it around, and of course, hack it to pieces to make it your own for what you need. Don't want to use eslint? Delete it.
